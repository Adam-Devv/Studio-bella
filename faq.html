                        <p><a href="services.html">Permanent cosmetic makeup</a> is cosmetic tattooing. The specialized techniques used for permanent cosmetics are often referred to as 'micropigmentation', 'micropigment implantation' or 'dermagraphics.' The cosmetic implantation technique deposits colored pigment into the upper reticular layer of the dermis.</p>

This may vary according to each individual and the skills of the technician performing the service. However, there are different methods available to help with <a href="blogs/permanent-makeup-pain-comfort-austin.html">pain management</a>, including various topical anesthetic ointments.

                        <p>Technically, permanent cosmetics procedures are considered permanent because the color is implanted into the upper reticular part of the dermal layer of the skin and cannot be washed off. However, as with any tattoo, <a href="blogs/permanent-makeup-longevity-guide.html">fading</a> can and often does occur, requiring periodic maintenance, color re-enhancement or color refresh, often referred to as a <a href="services.html">touch-up</a>. Just like hair color or furniture near a window, pigment implanted in the skin may fade with time.</p>

                        <p>Permanent cosmetics procedures are performed using various methods, including specialized tattoo machines (rotary or coil) and manual tools (like microblading). The process includes an <a href="consultation.html">initial consultation</a> to discuss goals and design, the application of pigment during the main procedure, and usually one or more follow-up visits (<a href="services.html">touch-ups</a>) for adjusting the color or density of the pigment.</p>

                        <p> When performed by a qualified technician like <a href="about.html">Cookie Bandel</a> who follows all <a href="blogs/permanent-makeup-safety-austin.html">proper sterilization and sanitary guidelines</a>, permanent cosmetics should be completely safe.

                        <ul>
                            <li>1. All needles are new, sterile, and single-use for each client.</li>
                            <li>2. Machine parts are either single-use or properly sterilized before each use.</li>
                            <li>3. All equipment and supplies are handled and stored in a sanitary manner.</li>
                            <li>4. New gloves are worn for each client and changed during the procedure as needed.</li>
                            <li>5. The technician maintains high standards of personal hygiene and environmental safety.</li>
                            <li>6. Treatment areas and surfaces are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between clients.</li>
                            <li>7. Procedures are performed in a clean environment free from contaminants.</li>

                        <p>Generally, there is some temporary swelling and redness in the treated area. Eyebrows typically show minimal swelling, while eyeliner and lips may show more, lasting from two to seventy-two hours. The pigment color will appear much darker initially and will soften over the first 6-10 days as it heals. Following <a href="blogs/lip-blush-aftercare-austin.html">aftercare instructions</a> carefully is crucial to minimize potential side effects and ensure proper healing.</p>
