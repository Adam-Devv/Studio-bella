					<h5>What is permanent cosmetic makeup?</h5>
					<p>Permanent cosmetic makeup is cosmetic tattooing. The specialized techniques used for permanent cosmetics are often referred to as 'micropigmentation', 'micropigment implantation' or 'dermagraphics.' The cosmetic implantation technique deposits colored pigment into the upper reticular layer of the dermis.</p>
					<h5>Does it hurt?</h5>
					<p> Virtually Painless. Topical anesthesia is used to alleviate discomfort during the procedure. This may vary according to each individual and the skills of the technician performing the service. However, there are different methods available to help with pain management, including various topical anesthetic ointments, anesthetic locals and nerve blocks (administered by a doctor or dentist). I will discuss these methods with you to determine which one suits you best.</p>
					<h5>Are Permanent Cosmetics Really Permanent?</h5>
					<p>Technically, permanent cosmetics procedures are considered permanent because the color is implanted into the upper reticular part of the dermal layer of the skin and cannot be washed off. However, as with any tattoo, fading can and often does occur, requiring periodic maintenance, color re-enhancement or color re-fresh. Just like hair color, furniture that may be located near a window, or even house paint, pigment implanted in the skin may fade with time.</p>
					<h5>How are permanent cosmetics done?</h5>
					<p>Permanent cosmetics procedures are performed using various methods, including the traditional tattoo or coil machines, the pen or rotary machine and the non-machine or hand method. The process includes an initial consultation, then application of pigment, and at least one or more follow up visits for adjusting the color or density of the pigment.</p>
					<h5>How Long Does Each Procedure Take?</h5>
					<p>The initial procedure will generally take approximately 1 to 2 Â½ hours. Touch up procedures usually do not require as much time.</p>
					
					
					
					<h5>Is it safe?</h5>
					<p> I follow all proper sterilization and sanitary guidelines, permanent cosmetics should be completely safe. These guidelines include the following:</p>
					<ul>

						<li>1. All Needles should be new and sterile for each client.</li>
						<li>2. Other machine parts should also be pre-sterilized and disposed of in a sanitary manner.</li>
						<li>3. Other equipment and supplies should be kept in a sanitary manner.</li>
						<li>4. Gloves should be new for each client and changed during the procedure when needed.</li>
						<li>5. The technician should be clean and neat and knowledgeable of environmental safety requirements.</li>
						<li>6. Clean sheets should be used for each patient.</li>
						<li>7. The room or treatment area should be in an area free from other contaminants.</li>
					</ul> </p>
					<h5>What If I Don't Like It?</h5>
					<p>Although the procedure is considered permanent, these procedures do have flexibility in changing color and shape to some extent. Colors will appear darker immediately following the procedure but will soften and lighten during the healing process. The healing time is different for each individual and procedure</p>
					<h5>Which Permanent Makeup Establishment Should I Choose?</h5>
					<p>Choose a technician carefully. It is important to remember that the shape and proper placement of the procedure is as important as the right color. The desired look is obtained during the course of consultation, initial procedure and follow up procedures. Interaction between the client and the technician should be of utmost importance.</p>
					<h5>Are There Any After or Side Effects?</h5>
					<p>Generally, there is some swelling of the treated area. While eyebrows my show little after effect, eyeliner and lips may show more and the edema may last from two to seventy two hours. The color is much darker than you may expect for the first six to ten days. Sometimes, people have reactions to antibiotics. You may use any type of antibiotic that you prefer for your individual system. There may be other side effects unforeseen due to individuality. </p>
					<h5>Do The Pigments Pose Allergy Problems?</h5>
					<p>The application is just deep enough to penetrate the minute capillaries in the dermal layer of skin. There have been so few reactions to the pigments that some doctors are suggesting that the patch test be eliminated. You can develop an allergy to anything, anytime. Some doctors recommend that people with allergies have permanent cosmetic procedures because they can replace cosmetic products that they are sensitive to.</p>
					<h5>Is There Any Possibility for Medical Problems?</h5>
					<p>The possibility that you would have any problems or reactions from these procedures is almost non-existent with today's health standards. SPCP member professionals are given continued opportunities for education in practicing precise methods of sanitation and sterilization. Post procedural instructions, if followed carefully, will completely eliminate any risk.</p>
					<h5>What's a Touch-Up and Do I Need One?</h5>
					<p>A touch-up is a color re-enhancement. Sometimes after a procedure the color fades after the first day or two. This is why we offer 1-2 complimentary touch-ups.</p>
					<h5>Who benefits from permanent cosmetics?</h5>
					<p>Everyone, from the young to the elderly, who desires a soft, natural enhancement to their appearance. It is especially beneficial to people who can't wear other cosmetics due to allergies and skin sensitivities; Active people who want to look their best for activities such as swimming, hiking, biking, tennis, aerobics, and those who don't want to worry about 'sweating off' or reapplying cosmetics. Also the vision impaired who have difficulty applying their cosmetics, and others with motor impairments such as arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke survivors, and those with unsteady hands who cannot apply their own makeup, and busy people who don't have time to spend on their makeup.</p>
