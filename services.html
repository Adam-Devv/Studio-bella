							<h3>Eyelash Enhancement</h3>
						</header>
						<p>This is what I like to do especially if you are at all apprehensive. This is really a cool procedure. I lay the pigment 'IN' the lash line. This makes your eyelashes look fuller than they actually are. It is also wonderful because your eyes always look nicely and naturally made up. On special occasions you can apply store bought eyeliner for a more dramatic appearance and still maintain a natural look on all other days.</p>

							<h3>Corrections</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I truly feel for people who have had a procedure gone wrong. Yes, I can fix most any cosmetic procedure that was done to you incorrectly. All of my clients were done with the gentlest of care. I am NEVER rushed, and I ALWAYS schedule more than enough time for your procedure. I believe that is why I have NEVER had a client who was not completely happy with my work.</p>
