								<h4>The Consultation</h4>
								<p>Consultations are always free and only take 15 to 30 minutes. They are thorough and extremely educational. I also have many professional makeup books and photo albums of my own work filled with pictures to help you see all that you can have done that you might not have even thought of before.</p>
            					<h4>Pricing</h4><p>For my permanent makeup, I really like to talk with you personally. It is important for you to understand what the whole process is, to know pre and post care, meet us, and view our facility.</p>

								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h2>Eyeliner</h2>This is usually +/- 1 mm in thickness and you can can rest assured it will be what you asked for. You are apart of the whole procedure, literally. You can have a mirror in your hand the whole time. No surprises!
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h2>White Eyeliner</h2>Is applied perfectly above eyeliner. This is a real nice effect and really makes your eyes light up. Also available in a variety of different colors and shades.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h2>Eyelash Enhancement</h2>Is what I like to do especially if you are at all apprehensive. This is really a cool procedure. I lay the pigment 'IN' the lash line. This makes your eyelashes look fuller than they actually are. It is also
                    wonderful because your eyes always look nicely and naturally made up. On special occasions you can apply store bought eyeliner for a more dramatic appearance and still maintain a natural look on all other days.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h2>Lips</h2>Some people just want lip liner to accentuate the shape of their lips and some want it all filled in with their favorite color and some even want both. And yes, you can still apply lipstick if you want a different color. But
                    you probably won't. It's just too fun to sit at a table and be the only one with no greasy smudges on your glass of water or wine.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h2>Eyebrows</h2>Can be filled in like a soft powder effect, hair strokes or both. We use two or three different shades to give your eyebrows dimension for those of us who have very few or no hair at all. These too are available in a variety
                    of different colors and shades.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Eyebrow Highlighter</h2>Ever so softly on the brow bone just below the eyebrow. A very inexpensive and virtually pain free procedure. Eyebrow highlighter adds a lift to your face without surgery.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Blush</h2>Delicately applied for a look like you've just been kissed by the sun.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Eye shadow</h2>Having permanent eye shadow is just so thrilling. No creases, and no reapplications. Soft powder like effect and many shades to choose from or create.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Eye Concealer</h2>Tired of it caking up? Well this is truly the best. Always look rested and fresh with no more dark circles under your eyes. This amazes everyone.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Areola</h2>Ask your Doctor when you can have your areola procedure scheduled. We use several colors for shading and dimension for a natural look.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Scar Camouflage</h2>Is very popular especially on that childhood scar in your eyebrow where hair won't grow. Or the scar that is too white for your skin tone or vise versa. You will literally forget where the scar was.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Corrections</h2>I truly feel for people who have had a procedure gone wrong. Yes, I can fix most any cosmetic procedure that was done to you incorrectly. All of my clients were done with the gentlest of care. I am NEVER rushed, and
                    I ALWAYS schedule more than enough time for your procedure. I believe that is why I have NEVER had a client who was not completely happy with my work.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Beauty Marks</h2>Yes, anywhere, any shape, any color, any size
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h2>Bindi</h2>I have applied Bindis in many different sizes and colors.

							<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br/>
						<strong>Does it hurt?</strong><br>
                    <br> Virtually Painless. Topical anesthesia is used to alleviate discomfort during the procedure. This may vary according to each individual and the skills of the technician performing the service. However, there are different methods
                    available to help with pain management, including various topical anesthetic ointments, anesthetic locals and nerve blocks (administered by a doctor or dentist). I will discuss these methods with you to determine which one suits you
                    best.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What is permanent cosmetic makeup?</b><br>
                    <br> Permanent cosmetic makeup is cosmetic tattooing. The specialized techniques used for permanent cosmetics are often referred to as 'micropigmentation', 'micropigment implantation' or 'dermagraphics.' The cosmetic implantation technique
                    deposits colored pigment into the upper reticular layer of the dermis.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How are permanent cosmetics done?</b><br>
                    <br> Permanent cosmetics procedures are performed using various methods, including the traditional tattoo or coil machines, the pen or rotary machine and the non-machine or hand method. The process includes an initial consultation,
                    then application of pigment, and at least one or more follow up visits for adjusting the color or density of the pigment.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Who benefits from permanent cosmetics?</b><br>
                    <br> Everyone, from the young to the elderly, who desires a soft, natural enhancement to their appearance. It is especially beneficial to people who can't wear other cosmetics due to allergies and skin sensitivities; Active people
                    who want to look their best for activities such as swimming, hiking, biking, tennis, aerobics, and those who don't want to worry about 'sweating off' or reapplying cosmetics. Also the vision impaired who have difficulty applying their
                    cosmetics, and others with motor impairments such as arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke survivors, and those with unsteady hands who cannot apply their own makeup, and busy people who don't have time to spend
                    on their makeup.<br>
                    <br>
                    

                    <b>Are Permanent Cosmetics Really Permanent?</b><br><br> Technically, permanent cosmetics procedures are considered permanent because the color is implanted into the upper reticular part of the dermal layer of the skin and cannot be
                    washed off. However, as with any tattoo, fading can and often does occur, requiring periodic maintenance, color re-enhancement or color re-fresh. Just like hair color, furniture that may be located near a window, or even house paint,
                    pigment implanted in the skin may fade with time.<br><br> 

                    <b>How Long Does Each Procedure Take?</b><br> The initial procedure will generally take approximately 1 to 2 Â½ hours. Touch up procedures usually do not require as much time.<br><br>




                    <b>Is it safe?</b><br><br> I follow all proper sterilization and sanitary guidelines, permanent cosmetics should be completely safe. These guidelines include the following: MOST IMPORTANT Things To Look For:<br> 1. All Needles should
                    be new and sterile for each client.<br> 2. Other machine parts should also be pre-sterilized and disposed of in a sanitary manner.<br> 3. Other equipment and supplies should be kept in a sanitary manner.<br> 4. Gloves should
                    be new for each client and changed during the procedure when needed.<br> 5. The technician should be clean and neat and knowledgeable of environmental safety requirements.<br> 6. Clean sheets should be used for each patient.<br>                    7. The room or treatment area should be in an area free from other contaminants.
                    <br><br>


                    <b>What If I Don't Like It?</b><br><br> Although the procedure is considered permanent, these procedures do have flexibility in changing color and shape to some extent. Colors will appear darker immediately following the procedure
                    but will soften and lighten during the healing process. The healing time is different for each individual and procedure<br><br>

                    <b>Which Technician Should I Choose?</b><br><br> Choose a technician carefully. It is important to remember that the shape and proper placement of the procedure is as important as the right color. The desired look is obtained during
                    the course of consultation, initial procedure and follow up procedures. Interaction between the client and the technician should be of utmost importance.<br><br>

                    <b>Are There Any After or Side Effects?</b><br><br> Generally, there is some swelling of the treated area. While eyebrows my show little after effect, eyeliner and lips may show more and the edema may last from two to seventy two hours.
                    The color is much darker than you may expect for the first six to ten days. Sometimes, people have reactions to antibiotics. You may use any type of antibiotic that you prefer for your individual system. There may be other side effects
                    unforeseen due to individuality.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Do The Pigments Pose Allergy Problems?</b><br><br> The application is just deep enough to penetrate the minute capillaries in the dermal layer of skin. There have been so few reactions to the pigments that some doctors are suggesting
                    that the patch test be eliminated. You can develop an allergy to anything, anytime. Some doctors recommend that people with allergies have permanent cosmetic procedures because they can replace cosmetic products that they are sensitive
                    to.<br><br>

                    <b>Is There Any Possibility for Medical Problems?</b><br><br> The possibility that you would have any problems or reactions from these procedures is almost non-existent with today's health standards. SPCP member professionals are given
                    continued opportunities for education in practicing precise methods of sanitation and sterilization. Post procedural instructions, if followed carefully, will completely eliminate any risk.<br><br>

                    <b>What's a Touch-Up and Do I Need One?</b><br><br> A touch-up is a color re-enhancement. Sometimes after a procedure the color fades after the first day or two. This is why we offer 1-2 complimentary touch-ups.
