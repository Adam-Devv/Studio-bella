				<h2>Permanent Cosmetics</h2>
			
				<p>Permanent cosmetic makeup is cosmetic tattooing. The specialized techniques used for permanent cosmetics are often referred to as 'micropigmentation', 'micropigment implantation' or 'dermagraphics.' The cosmetic implantation technique deposits colored pigment into the upper reticular layer of the dermis.</p>
				<p>Permanent cosmetics procedures are performed using various methods, including the traditional tattoo or coil machines, the pen or rotary machine and the non-machine or hand method. The process includes an initial consultation, then application of pigment, and at least one or more follow up visits for adjusting the color or density of the pigment.</p>
				<p>We offer a wide range of services such as Lips, Lip Liner, Eyebrows, Eyelienr, Blush, Beauty Marks, Repairs, Areola Repigmentation, and much more!</p>

				<p>Consultations are always free and only take 15 to 30 minutes. They are thorough and extremely educational. I also have many professional makeup books and photo albums of my own work filled with pictures to help you see all that you can have done that you might not have even thought of before!</p>
